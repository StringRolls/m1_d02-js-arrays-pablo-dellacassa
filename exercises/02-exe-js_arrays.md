# JS | Arrays

## Exercise

1. Using `push` and `unshift`, make this array contain the numbers from zero through seven:

```js
const arr = [2, 3, 4];

// your code here

console.log(arr); // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

2. What is _returned_ by `push`? Before throwing this into the console, form a hypothesis about what you think the return value will be:

```js
const arr = [5, 7, 9];
arr.push(6); // returns ???
```

3. Change all numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:

```js
const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

// your code here

numbers; // => [8, 18, 14, 4, 2, 16]
```

4. Change all **odd** numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:

```js
const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

// your code here

numbers; // => [4, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]
```

5.  Starting with an empty array called `rainbowColors`:

    - Add "orange" to the end of the array
    - Add "red" to the start of the array
    - Add "yellow" to the end
    - Add "green", "blue", "indigo", and "violet" to the end of the array
      - Try and do this using _one_ method
    - Print the length of the array
    - Print the second item
    - Print the last item (make this flexible/dynamic!)
    - Print the index of the string "blue"

6.  Find out the difference between `.slice` and `.splice`

    - Create an array called `twoColors` using one method - don't change the `rainbowColors` array! Essentially pull two colors out of the array (say, between the index of 1 and 3)
    - Starting with this array `var nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5];`, remove the duplicates _destructively_ using _slice_ or _splice_ (whichever one is appropriate)
